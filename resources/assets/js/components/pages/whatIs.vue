        <hr>
        <p>Now, if you're anything like my friends, if I was to tell you I've found a great way to make <strong>risk free money from gambling</strong>
        you would be hesitant to believe me. That's part of the reason why I made this website, to prove to them and anyone else who is curious that it's possible and quite easy to do.
        </p>

        <p>In just under two weeks of using this technique in my spare time I was able to profit over $700. I never lost any money during this time, and at no point was I actually at risk of doing so.
        </p>

        <p>Now I wouldn't just expect you to take my word for it, so let me run you through the process and you can see for yourself that it truly is risk free.
        </p>

         <h2>Concept</h2>
         <p>The concept of Matched Betting is quite simple. You bet for an outcome to happen on a Bookmaker Site (e.g. for Real Madrid win a soccer game), while on a Betting Exchange you bet against the same outcome (e.g. you bet that Real Madrid will <u>not</u> win)
         </p>
         
         <p>This means whate ever the outcome, one of your bets is going to win. Now the way the odds are setup, you still won't make a profit from doing this with your own money (that would be too easy right?). This technique only works when the bet one of the bets is a <strong>Bonus Bet</strong>. These are easily obtained by signing up to a Bookmaker and meeting their deposit criteria.
         </p>
         
          
         
         <h2>Terminology</h2>
         <p>Before running through an example let's start with some terminology that will help make everything easier to understand.
         </p>    


        <li><strong>Back Bet:</strong> To 'back' a selection in a market is to place a bet for something to happen. This is the type of bet that you would place with a traditional <u>Bookmaker</u>. </li>
        <li><strong>Bonus Bet:</strong> A bonus bet is a betting credit awarded by a bookmaker, these are typically in the form of a sign up bonus or offered ad hoc for depositing a set amount of money. </li>
        <li><strong>Lay Bet:</strong> To 'lay' a selection in a market is to place a bet for something NOT to happen, or in other words, bet against something happening. This is done on a <u>Betfair.</u>  If your Lay Bet is successful, you always get twice your money back as this is the money that someone else has bet on a Win. If you lose a Lay Bet you pay your Liability.</li>
        <li><strong>Liability:</strong> When laying a team, you play the part of the traditional Bookmaker. If your bet doesn’t work out as planned, you need to pay out as a traditional Bookmaker would. This is referred to as your Liability.</li>
        <li><strong>Turnover Requirement:</strong> This is amount of money that you must wager with a Bookmaker before they let you withdraw any winnings from a bonus bet. This turnover limit can apply to your deposit, your bonus bet and your bonus winngs. Make sure to read the website terms and conditions to identify this.</li>
        <li><strong>Commission:</strong> As a Betting Exchange is essentially 'peer to peer' betting, they charge a commission on the winnings you make.</li>

        <h2>Example</h2>       
        <p>I will now run you through an example, using the calculator I have built into this website. This calculator ensures you get the same profit from either outcome, and that any turnover requirements are met to make sure you can withdraw your money.</p>
        
        <blockquote><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Sign up to Betfair using the link below.

        <blockquote><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign up to a Bookmaker  and claim your Bonus Bet.
        </p> <p><u>Check out the Bonus Bets tab above for a list of websites currently offering Bonus Bets!</u></p>

        </blockquote>    


        <blockquote><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find your bet!
        </p> You can use <a href="https://www.freebets4all.com/AutoMatcher" target="_blank">AutoMatcher</a> to find the optimal bet that will return a higher percent of your Bonus Bet. Just change the "Optimise for Bet Type..." dropdown to SNR Free Bet Profit. The SNR (%) represents the percentage of your bonus bet you can win back.
        <figure class="image">

        </figure>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The higher the Lay Odds, the higher your liability (and hence the amount you need to deposit onto the Betting Exchange). You will get this money back but it may not be optimal if you do not have a large amount of cash at your disposal. Lower odds typically result in a lower percentage of your Bonus Bet being returned.
        </p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Find the Turnover Requirements for the Bookmaker, these are usually found in the Terms and Conditions.
        <figure class="image">
        <img src="../../assets/TurnoverRequirement.png">
        </figure>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> There is always a Turnover Requirement of 1x on your deposit. The Turnover Requirement for the bonus bet value and winnings usually varies from Bookmaker to Bookmaker.
        </p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Use the Matched Betting Calculator to determine how much you need to bet.
        <p>In this example we are using the Back Odds of $4 and the Lay Odds of $4.40. The Turnover Requirements are 1x for Deposit, Bonus Bet Value, and Bonus Bet Winnings. Ladbrokes do not return the value of the bonus bet in your winnings, some Bookmakers will. The Betting Exchange BetFair charges 5% commission.
         </p> 
        <figure class="image">
        <img src="../../assets/Bet1Calc.png">
        </figure>
        <p>To ensure an even profit on either outcome, we need to make a $183.87 Lay Bet which requires depositing $625.14. We will make a $250 Back Bet of which $200 is our bonus bet. As you can see from the returns, no matter the outcome we will profit $124.67 (Approximately 62% of the Bonus Bet).
        </p>
        <p>You can see in this instance we have an additional Turnover Requirement to meet because if the Back Bet wins (as you are typically backing a non-favourite/high odds outcome this happens less often than the Lay Bet winning in my experience). This will reduce our profit but is necessary to withdraw the funds risk free. 
        </p>
        <p>If the Lay Bet wins, you can withdraw your winnings and repeat the process with another Bonus Bet!
        </p>

        </blockquote>  

        <blockquote><p><strong>Step 6: Make your bets</strong></p>
        In this case we are placing a Back Bet of $250 @ $4 on a Draw outcome.
        <figure class="image">
        <img src="../../assets/BackBet.png" style="width:310px;height:135px;">
        </figure>
        And a Lay Bet of $183.87 @ $4.40 that a Draw will not occur:
        <figure class="image">
        <img src="../../assets/LayBet.png" style="width:525px;height:173px;">
        </figure>
        </blockquote> 

     
        <blockquote><p><strong>Step 7: This is only required if you have turnover requirements. </strong> Find another match using the AutoMatcher, and enter the odds to find out what you need to bet.
        <p>Now that you have satisfied your Turnover Requirement on the Bookmaker you can withdraw your money regardless of if the Back Bet or Lay Bet win. As you can see the profit has been significantly reduced, and for this reason it is best to find Bookmakers that don't have Turnover Requirements on Bonus Winnings.

        <blockquote><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Repeat for as many sign up bonuses as you can find!</p>
