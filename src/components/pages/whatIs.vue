      <div class="content has-text-left">

        <hr>
        <p>Now, if you're anything like my friends, if I was to tell you I've found a great way to make <strong>risk free money from gambling</strong>
        you would be a little dubious. That's part of the reason why I made this website, to prove to them and anyone else who is curious that it's possible and quite easy to do.
        </p>

        <p>In just over two weeks of using this technique in my spare time I was able to profit over $700. I never lost any money during this time, and at no point was actually at risk of doing so.
        </p>

        <p>Now I wouldn't just expect you to take my word for it, so let me run you through the process and you can see for yourself that it truly is risk free.
        </p>

         <h2>Concept</h2>
         <p>The concept of Matched Betting is quite simple. You bet for an outcome to happen on a bookmaker site (e.g. for Real Madrid win a soccer game), while on a betting exchange you bet against the same outcome (e.g. you bet that Real Madrid will <u>not</u> win)
         </p>
         
         <p>This means whate ever the outcome, one of your bets is going to win. Now the way the odds are setup, you still won't make a profit from doing this with your own money (that would be too easy right?). This technique only works when the bet one of the bets is a <strong>bonus bet</strong>. These are easily obtained by signing up to a bookmaker site and meeting their deposit criteria.
         </p>

         <h2>Terminology</h2>
         <p>Before running through an example let's start with some terminology that will help make everything clear.
         </p>    


        <li><strong>Back Bet:</strong> To 'back' a selection in a market is to place a bet for something to happen. This is the type of bet that you would place with a traditional <u>bookmaker</u>. </li>
        <li><strong>Bonus Bet:</strong> A bonus bet is a betting credit awarded by a bookmaker, these are typically in the form of a sign up bonus or offered ad hoc for depositing a certain amount of money. </li>
        <li><strong>Lay Bet:</strong> To 'lay' a selection in a market is to place a bet for something NOT to happen, or in other words, bet against something happening. This is done on a <u>betting exchange</u> </li>
        <li><strong>Liability:</strong> When laying a team, you play the part of the traditional bookmaker. If your bet doesn’t work out as planned, you need to pay out as a traditional bookmaker would. This is referred to as your liability</li>
        <li><strong>Turnover Requirement:</strong> This is amount of money that you must wager with a bookmaker before they let you withdraw any winnings from a bonus bet. This turnover limit can apply to your deposit, your bonus bet and your bonus winngs. Make sure to read the website terms and conditions to identify this.</li>
        <li><strong>Commission:</strong> As a betting exchange is essentially 'peer to peer' betting, they charge a commission percentage for the winnings you make.</li>

        <h2>Example</h2>       
        <p>I will now run you through an example, using the calculator I have built into this website. This calculator ensures you get the same profit from either outcome, and that any turnover requirements are met to make sure you can withdraw your money.</p>
